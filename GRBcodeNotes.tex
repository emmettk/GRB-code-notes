\section{Sources}
The code considered here are the files:
\\ example-DelayedCoincidence-and-Veto-SolarAntiNeutrino.cc
\\ example-Read-DelayedCoincidenceEvent-LikelihoodRatio-HighEnergy-shimizu-ishidoshiro.cc

The paper corresponding to this code is:
``Study of electron anti-neutrinos associated with gamma-ray bursts using KamLAND''. (arXiv: 1503.02137) 

\section{Background}
This code is related to the detection of delayed coincidence event pairs. This is a pair of events which, together, provide a signature for inverse beta decay, and thus the detection of antineutrinos. 

The inverse beta decay reaction is: 
$$\bar \nu_e + p \rightarrow e^+ +n$$
